   <h1>About DNSCrypt!</h1>
   <p>This software encrypts DNS packets between your computer and OpenDNS. This prevents man-in-the-middle attacks and snooping of DNS traffic by ISPs or others.</p>
<p>Tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have a firewall or other middleware mangling your packets, try enabling DNSCrypt with TCP over port 443.
<li>If you prefer reliability over security, enable fallback to insecure DNS.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please help by providing feedback!</p>
