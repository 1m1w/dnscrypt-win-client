  <h2>Version 0.0.4 early preview testing</h2>
  <div class="date"><p>Updated: Mon, 7 May 2012</p></div>
  <ul>
  <li>DNSCrypt now handles captive portals more cleanly. When "Use DNSCrypt" and "Fail over to insecure" are checked and a captive portal is encountered, the program
  fails open internally, but continues to attempt to turn on encryption as soon as it can. The old behavior simply turned off encryption until the user re-checked it.</li>
  <li>"Fail over to insecure" is checked by default.</li>
  </ul>
